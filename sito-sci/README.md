# sito.sci
Serialization tools for science libraries
## Package namespace is a work in progress

Note: I am currently trying and struggling to get package namespaces to 
work with setuptools_scm. However, I cannot seem to find the happy path that
setuptools_scm, pip, pip -e, and achieve the correct behavior. 
For now, sito-sci will be a separate namespace.
